how to data
===========

I'd like to start building out notebooks that other people can use to learn the very least they need to start exploring data with a system as robust and conducive to reproducibility as the python science stack. For now this is rough and I'm embarrassed, but anyone inclined to give feedback is welcome to do so!

I've included a requirements file that should provide what you need to run the scripts I'm using. You should be able simply to navigate to the directory where you have cloned this repo and type

    pip install -r requirements.txt

For more complete information on this you can [read the docs](http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/reference/pip_install.html#requirements-file-format)!
